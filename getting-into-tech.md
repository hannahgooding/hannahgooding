# ü§ñ GETTING INTO TECH ü§ñ

I went from a complete beginner, to a paid software engineer in 16 months. I get asked for tips about getting into tech a lot from people who see this and also want to switch careers, so I decided to write this guide.

Disclaimer: All of this is based on my specific personal experience. I don't have a Computer Science degree, but I do have a degree (BA in Philosophy) and previous work experience. I had a lot of help on the way from my very supportive friends and mentors.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Why I became a software engineer

After a few years of working in various roles in fashion, I decided I wanted a career change.
For a while I had been complaining about my lack of prospects, unclear career trajectory, and how I didn't feel intellectually challenged.
Some of my very inspiring friends who are women in tech suggested I look into tech jobs, so I set myself the goal of learning to code.

I chose tech because:
- Coding is challenging üß†
- Anyone can learn to code, even for free ‚å®Ô∏è
- It's a well paid industry, and there are no shortage of jobs üí∏
- Jobs in the industry are flexible - both in terms of time, and also what jobs you can transition into üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- You can work anywhere in the world üåé 

## üëü First Steps
I started with web development, mostly because I already knew a little bit of HTML from ICT at school (and tweaking my Myspace profile of course...),
but really you can start with any programming language.

I thought I would start by teaching myself, so after making "learning to code" my 2019 New Year's Resolution, I made a Codecademy account and then did...
absolutely no coding. I realised I needed a bit more structure so I enrolled on an eight week Code First Girls course after work. Through this I built a 
website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript from scratch, and realised how much I enjoyed coding.

After this I set my sights on getting onto the Founders and Coders (FAC) bootcamp because they offer an amazing curriculum with mentorship and employment support.
There are [pre-requisites](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/apply/#application-requirements) to getting onto the bootcamp, so this gave me more structure for my learning. 
Oh, and because the bootcamp is communnity run it is absolutely free! Other bootcamps can cost upwards of ¬£8k, so I was desperate to get on, 
which gave me even more motivation to learn.

I saved up and quit my job to do FAC. I would throughly recommend the course/bootcamp route into programming, 
I met so many amazing people and I am still active in the alumni community. 
But of course there are limited number of spaces, costs and other limitations such as time, location, etc. 

So here are some extra tips...

## üí° Tips
- Follow a course or curriculum to have some structure to your learning.
- Using free online resources is a great way to start because you can suss out what programming languages you like, and whether you enjoy coding every day, 
without committing to paying.
- If you find a resource particularly difficult to learn from, try something else. Don't just stick at something that isn't working because it feels like "giving up". Everyone learns in their own way.
- Find other people to code with. You can learn really important skills like pair programming and version control which you can't learn on your own. 
You also question and prove your knowledge when you have to explain your code to others.
- Join coding communities and attend meet-ups (there are virtual ones) to find people to connect with and ask questions.
- Find a mentor who you identify with who can give you some direction.
- If you have Twitter you can start tweeting about your coding journey, the tech community is very supportive on there - I would recommend looking at the #100DaysOfCode and #CodeNewbie tags.
- Blogging your coding journey can help you keep track of your learning. This can be in any form, during my bootcamp I got given the tip to post a "today I learned" everyday which I did on [Wordpress](https://hannahwsgooding.wordpress.com/). These can also be daily/weekly tweets, or public posts to forums like [Dev.to](https://dev.to/).
- Try not to compare your learning speed to others, everyone learns at their own pace, has their own personal circumstances, and has different ideas of when they feel comfortable saying they "know" something.

## üìö Resources for beginners

There are absolutely tonnes of resources out there, and there can never be an exhaustive list. These are the ones that I personally used and found helpful.

### Free Online Resources

#### Web Development
- The [Founders and Coders Curriculum](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/) is open-source so you can study it even if you don't attend the bootcamp as a cohort member
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - great for HTML and CSS basics, I found JavaScript difficult to learn on this platform

#### CSS Games
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - learn about CSS Flexbox
- [Grid Garden](https://codepip.com/games/grid-garden/) - learn about CSS Grid
- [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) - learn about CSS Selectors

#### Other
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) - you can do Codewars challenges in most programming languages from beginner to advanced levels, I have used it for testing my knowledge in JavaScript, Python, Ruby and SQL


### Paid Online Resources

#### Courses
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) - great for giving you projects to build and they often have flash sales (I use these a lot at work to learn new technologies)
