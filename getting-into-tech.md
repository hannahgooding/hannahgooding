# ü§ñ GETTING INTO TECH ü§ñ

I went from a complete beginner, to a paid software engineer in 16 months, without paying for tuition. I get asked for tips about getting into tech a lot from people who see this and also want to switch careers, so I decided to write this guide.

_Disclaimer: All of this is based on my specific personal experience. I don't have a Computer Science degree, but I do have a degree (BA in Philosophy) and previous work experience. I had a lot of help on the way from my very supportive friends and mentors._

## üë©‚Äçüíª Why I became a software engineer

After a few years of working in various roles in fashion, I decided I wanted a career change.
For a while I had been complaining about my lack of prospects, unclear career trajectory, and how I didn't feel intellectually challenged.
Some of my very inspiring friends who are women in tech suggested I look into tech jobs, so I set myself the goal of learning to code.

I chose tech because:
- Coding is challenging üß†
- Anyone can learn to code, even for free ‚å®Ô∏è
- It's a well paid industry, and there are no shortage of jobs üí∏
- Jobs in the industry are flexible - both in terms of time, and also what jobs you can transition into üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- You can work anywhere in the world üåé 

## üëü First Steps
I started with web development, mostly because I already knew a little bit of HTML from ICT at school (and tweaking my Myspace profile of course...),
but really you can start with any programming language.

I thought I would start by teaching myself, so after making "learning to code" my 2019 New Year's Resolution, I made a Codecademy account and then did...
absolutely no coding. I realised I needed to be held accountable to learning so I enrolled on an eight week Code First Girls course after work. Through this I built a website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript from scratch, and realised how much I enjoyed coding.

After this I set my sights on getting onto the Founders and Coders (FAC) bootcamp because they offer an amazing curriculum with mentorship and employment support.
There are [pre-requisites](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/apply/#application-requirements) to getting onto the bootcamp, so this gave me more structure for my learning. 
Oh, and because the bootcamp is community run it is absolutely free! Other bootcamps can cost upwards of ¬£8k, so I was desperate to get on, 
which gave me even more motivation to learn.

Whilst making my way through the course pre-reqs, I attended codebar meetups every week where I would be able to iron out any questions with a coach FOR FREE with FREE PIZZA!

I eventually saved up and quit my job to do FAC. I would throughly recommend the course/bootcamp route into programming, 
I met so many amazing people and I am still active in the alumni community. 
But of course there are limited number of spaces, costs and other limitations such as time, location, etc. 

So here are some extra tips...

## üí° Tips
- Follow a course or curriculum in your own time to have some structure to your learning.
- Using free online resources is a great way to start because you can suss out what programming languages you like, and whether you enjoy coding every day, 
without committing to paying.
- If you find a resource particularly difficult to learn from, try something else. Don't just stick at something that isn't working because it feels like "giving up". Everyone learns in their own way.
- Join coding communities and attend meet-ups or conferences (there are virtual ones)
  -  To find people to connect with and ask questions.
  - To find other people to code with. You can learn really important skills like pair programming and version control which you can't learn on your own. 
You also question and prove your knowledge when you have to explain your code to others.
  - To find a mentor who you identify with who can give you some direction.
- If you don't already have Twitter I would recommend getting it, the tech community is very supportive on there, and you can find people who represent you in the industry. The tech people I follow are in this [list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1364385401113305088).
- Blogging your coding journey can help you keep track of your learning. This can be in any form, during my bootcamp I got given the tip to post a "today I learned" everyday which I did on [Wordpress](https://hannahwsgooding.wordpress.com/). 
- These can also be daily/weekly tweets, or public posts to forums like [Dev.to](https://dev.to/). If you want to start tweeting about your coding journey - I would recommend looking at the #100DaysOfCode and #CodeNewbie tags.
- Try not to compare your learning speed to others, everyone learns at their own pace, has their own personal circumstances, and has different ideas of when they feel comfortable saying they "know" something.

## üìö Resources for beginners

There are absolutely tonnes of resources out there, and there can never be an exhaustive list. These are the ones that I personally used and found helpful enough to endorse.

### üå± Free Online Resources

#### Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- The [Founders and Coders Curriculum](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/) is open-source so you can study it even if you don't attend the bootcamp as a cohort member.
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - great for HTML and CSS basics, note: I found JavaScript difficult to learn on this platform.
- [General Assembly Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/) - great for following along and quickly seeing how HTML, CSS and JavaScript can be combined to build something that looks great.

#### JavaScript
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - searching for a particular concept on YouTube or following a video tutorial was the easiest way I found to practicing JS code.

#### CSS Games
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - learn about CSS Flexbox.
- [Grid Garden](https://codepip.com/games/grid-garden/) - learn about CSS Grid.
- [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) - learn about CSS Selectors.

#### Any
- [Codebar Tutorials](http://tutorials.codebar.io/) - great introductions to various languages, you can also join the community Slack channel and find others to learn with.
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) - you can do Codewars challenges in most programming languages from beginner to advanced levels. I have used it for testing my knowledge in JavaScript, Python, Ruby and SQL.
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - I found some JavaScript concepts hard to learn on this platform (maybe I just found JavaScript hard to learn full-stop...), but it gave me a good introduction to Ruby and Python which I needed for job interviews.

### üí∞ Paid Online Resources

There's so much free stuff out there for beginner level, I don't pay unless it's something I feel I can't learn elsewhere. 

[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) courses are great for giving you a course structured around building a project. They can be expensive, but have 30-day money-back guarantees, and also often have flash sales. There are also some free courses on the site.

I still use these a lot at work to learn new technologies (I get a training budget with my job).

### üçï Meet-ups
- [Codebar](https://codebar.io/) - a meetup for members of under-represented groups in tech can attend as students. Students are assigned a volunteer coach for their chosen programming language. When they are IRL they are hosted by a company and there is free food.
- Founders and Coders run meet ups for those interested in learning about the course and want to pair program together.
