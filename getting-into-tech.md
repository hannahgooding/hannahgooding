# 🤖 GETTING INTO TECH 🤖

## 👩‍💻 Why I became a software engineer
After a few years of working in various roles in fashion, I decided I wanted a career change.
For a while I had been complaining about my lack of prospects, unclear career trajectory, and how I didn't feel intellectually challenged.
Some of my very inspiring friends who are women in tech suggested I look into tech jobs, so I set myself the goal of learning to code.

I chose tech because:
- Coding is challenging 🧠
- Anyone can learn to code, even for free ⌨️
- It's a well paid industry, and there are no shortage of jobs 💸
- Jobs in the industry are flexible - both in terms of time, and also what jobs you can transition into 🧘‍♀️
- You can work anywhere in the world 🌎 

## 👟 First Steps
I started with web development, mostly because I already knew a little bit of HTML from ICT at school (and tweaking my Myspace profile of course...),
but really you can start with any programming language.

I thought I would start by teaching myself, so after making "learning to code" my 2019 New Year's Resolution, I made a Codecademy account and then did...
absolutely no coding. I realised I needed a bit more structure so I enrolled on an eight week Code First Girls course after work. Through this I built a 
website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript from scratch, and realised how much I enjoyed coding.

After this I set my sights on getting onto the Founders and Coders (FAC) bootcamp because they offer an amazing curriculum with mentorship and employment support.
There are [pre-requisites](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/apply/#application-requirements) to getting onto the bootcamp, so this gave me more structure for my learning. 
Oh, and because the bootcamp is communnity run it is absolutely free! Other bootcamps can cost upwards of £8k, so I was desperate to get on, 
which gave me even more motivation to learn.

I saved up and quit my job to do FAC. I would throughly recommend the course/bootcamp route into programming, 
I met so many amazing people and I am still active in the alumni community. 
But of course there are limited number of spaces, costs and other limitations such as time, location, etc. 

So here are some extra tips...

## 💡 Tips
- Follow a course or curriculum to have some structure to your learning
- Using free online resources is a great way to start because you can suss out what programming languages you like, and whether you enjoy coding every day
- Find other people to code with, you can learn really important skills like pair programming and version control, and you learn more when you have to 
explain your code to others
- Join coding communities and attend meet-ups (there are virtual ones) to find people to connect with and ask questions
- If you have Twitter you can start tweeting about your coding journey, the tech community is very supportive on there - I would recommend looking at the #100DaysOfCode and #CodeNewbie tags
